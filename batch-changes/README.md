#### About Batch Changes

Batch Changes is a tool to apply and track code changes across many repositories and code hosts. You specify a Sourcegraph search [query](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+file:build.gradle+NOT+content:%23upgrade-log4j-gradle-cve-2021-44228&patternType=literal) to get a list of repositories and a script to run in each, then Batch Changes opens changesets on all affected repositories or projects and tracks them until they are merged.
